# Arduino Quadruped Spider Robot

## Overview

This project showcases the creation of a quadruped spider robot using Arduino, 12 servo motors, and a 3D-printed body. The robot employs inverse kinematics to achieve coordinated and lifelike leg movements. With four legs, each comprising three joints, the robot exhibits remarkable flexibility and precision in navigating its environment.
